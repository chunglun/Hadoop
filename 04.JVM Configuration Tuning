A. JVM Flags
       1. AggressiveOpts
            governs whether certain other optimizations are enabled by the JVM or not
            the optimizations enabled by these flags could very depending on the JVM version
            disabled by default on Oracle JDK7 Update 5
       2. UseCompressedOops
            compressed ordinary object pointers help reduce memory footprint of 64-bit
             JVMs at the expense of reduced total addressable Java heap space
            enabled by default on Oracle JDK7 Update 5
       3. UseBiasedLocking
            improves performance in situations where locks are generally un-contended
            enabled by default on Oracle JDK7 Update 5
