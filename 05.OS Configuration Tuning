A. Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
       1. THP feature of RHEL 6.2 and above aims at simplifying management of huge pages.
       2. Hadoop workloads with THP feature enabled
             high kernel space CPU utilization caused by the compaction process of THP
             cause large regressions
             Ex: test noticed as much as 66% regression with THP enabled
             disable THP feature

B. File System Choice And Attributes
       1. The choice of file system can have significant impact on performance of Hadoop
          workload especially for IO intensive workloads
             Test shows EXT4 supported by RHEL 6.3 is significantly better than EXT3
       2. In the absence of noatime attribute, every file read operation triggers a disk
          write operation for maintaining last access time of the file.
             disable this metadata logging by adding noatime attribute to the FS mount
              options of the data disks
             Ex: test noticed 29% improvement in performance by using noatime
            
C. IO Scheduler Choice
       1. Majority of Linux distributions support 4 type of IO schedulers: 
           (1) CFQ
           (2) deadline
           (3) noop
           (4) anticipatory
       2. Depending on pattern of IO operations, the hardware configuration of IO 
          subsystem and the requirements of the application, a particular IO scheduler
          may perform better
       3. The default IO scheduler vary depending on the Linux distribution
             Ubuntu 11.04 uses deadline
             RHEL 6.3 users CFQ
             Ex: test noticed 15% improvement by using CFQ instead of deadline
