(1) download the data set in http://www.hadoop.tw/excite-small.log 
(2) run Pig script on Hadoop MapReduce (YARN)
在 Hadoop MapReduce (YARN) 上執行 pig 腳本， 將以 HDFS 上的 pig_output 目錄作為驗證

(Pig Script)
 log = LOAD 'excite-small.log' AS (user, timestamp, query);  
 grpd = GROUP log BY user;                                   
 cntd = FOREACH grpd GENERATE group, COUNT(log) AS cnt;      
 fltrd = FILTER cntd BY cnt > 50;                            
 srtd = ORDER fltrd BY cnt;                                  
 STORE srtd INTO '/tmp/pig_output';

Score:
resulting directory can be found on HDFS (7%)
the result inside /tmp/pig_output is correct (8%)
